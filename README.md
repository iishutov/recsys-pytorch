The code from my educational practice, Semester VII.

The purpose of the practice is to create a graph neural network model for movie rating prediction (MovieLens Dataset).

1. [test](/test) folder contains some code for checking whether PyTorch, CUDA or Optuna have installed correctly. There also basic functionality were learned.
2. [overview](/overview) folder contains the solution for MNIST Dataset. Here I built my first PyTorch feed forward neural network and perform simple fine tuning using Optuna framework.
